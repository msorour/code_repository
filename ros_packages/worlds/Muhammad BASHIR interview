1. Beginner in ROS, but used it.
2. Few information on Kinematics/Dynamics, from courses studied in undergrad, probably didn't use it much.
3. Strong interest in computer vision applications, with experimental hands on.
4. Use "Real Time" term in the general sense of no observable delay, but no knowledge about RTOS.
5. Strong motivation.
