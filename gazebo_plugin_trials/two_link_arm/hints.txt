2. in model.config the entry "<sdf >model.sdf</sdf>" should contain the correct name of the .sdf file

3. run the simulator using (-u will launch in pause mode): 
  >> gzserver -u two_link_arm_world.world --verbose

5. if you make changes, compile first by going to build/ folder:
  >> cmake ../ && make

6. in .sdf model format, the joint pose is specified with respect to the child origin frame by default.
