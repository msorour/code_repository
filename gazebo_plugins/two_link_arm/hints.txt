1. model.sdf and model.config should be placed in a folder having the name of the robot which in turn should be placed in ~/.gazebo/models folder

2. in model.config the entry "<sdf >model.sdf</sdf>" should contain the correct name of the .sdf file

3. run the simulator using (-u will launch in pause mode): 
  >> gzserver -u two_link_arm_world.world --verbose

4. run the gazebo gui using:
  >> gzclient

5. if you make changes, compile first by going to build/ folder:
  >> cmake ../ && make

6. in .sdf model format, the joint pose is specified with respect to the child origin frame by default.

7. setting joint initial configuration:
		to do this we use the API function "SetJointPositions()" which takes a map "EX: std::map<std::string, double> init_joint_config_map;" filled as follows: "EX: init_joint_config_map["panda_arm::panda_arm_joint1"] = 1.57;" where the first element is a string containing the scoped name of the joint (which we can get using the API function "GetScopedName()") and the second element is the joint initial position.
